The code will undergo two phases:
Memory Phase
Execution Phase
In Memory phase

function showName(){  // Function declaration is hoisted to the top of their scope with its entire function body. Since showName() is in the global scope, it’s hoisted to the top of the global scope.
    function foo(){};      // As mentioned above, it is hoisted to the top its scope. In this case, in the function scope showName() along with its entire function body. So, foo becomes the local variable of type 'function'.
    foo = 'PANDA';       
    return;
};
var foo = undefined;   // Only the declaration of 'var' is attached to the global scope with default initialization to 'undefined'. 
Note: "During hoisting, JavaScript places function declarations like function showName() { ... } in memory before any var declarations, even if the var appears earlier in the source code."


In the Execution Phase

showName(); // Runs, but only changes local `foo` to PANDA
console.log(foo); // LION
Explanation:

In the execution phase, var foo is re-initialised to 'LION' and in the execution of the function showName(), the function, foo(){} as hoisted to the top of its function body, will be overridden by the next line's foo variable with value 'PANDA', this foo becomes a local variable. Thus, on the console, we see 'LION' for foo.

 
 // Solution for method hoisting Example
/*
❌ TypeError: myObjA.sayHello is not a function. 
When JS engine sees console.log(myObj.sayHello()), 
myObjA is 'undefined' at that point (assignment hasn’t happened yet) 
and thus, trying to access sayHello from undefined throws an error.
*/
console.log(myObjA.sayHello());

/*
❌ ReferenceError: Cannot access 'myObjB' before initialization. 
When JS engine tries to run: 
*/
console.log(myObjB.sayHello()); 

/*
Since myObjB is still in the TDZ, a ReferenceError is thrown.
*/
console.log(myObjB.sayHello())

var myObjA = {
  sayHello: function () {
    return "Hello!";
  }
};

const myObjB = {
  sayHello: function () {
    return "Hello!";
  }
};
